2. I was born in 1996 in Minsk, btw where I've been living for ages. I graduated from high school in 2014, then entered in the Belarussian State Economical University.  

My grandfather was a professor. My father is a professor too, so I decided became a professor. With shis purpose I continued learning and entered BSEU's masters. In 2019 I got **master's degree in technical sciences** . Then I  refused offer to postgraduate. 
Now I'm working as a commodity expert in a bookshop. And i have a big motivation to change my job, my scope of activity.
